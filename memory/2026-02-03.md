## Brand Alignment
- **Ascent XR** = Parent company, internal tools, dashboards
- **Learning Time VR** = School-facing education brand (LinkedIn, public content)
- **LinkedIn content uses LTVR:** learningtimevr.com URLs, LTVR colors (blue #0052cc, red #DC1625)
- **Internal systems use Ascent XR:** ascentxr.com URLs, dark blue/orange palette

## Brand Correction Applied
- All LinkedIn Week 1 posts: learningtimevr.com URLs
- All LinkedIn Week 2 posts: learningtimevr.com URLs  
- Image specs updated for Learning Time VR branding (not Ascent XR)
- Corporate structure: LinkedIn/school-facing = LTVR | Internal/developer = Ascent XR

## FEB 3 EVENING - Dashboard Deployment Issue Resolved

### Problem
- Dashboard showing v15 (old cached version) instead of v18
- Files in `/home/jim/openclaw/` not syncing to live server
- Telegram context overflow issue preventing communication

### Solution
- Obtained FTP credentials from Jim via Slack
- Deployed all v18 files via FTP to Bluehost:
  - ✅ unified_dashboard.html (134KB)
  - ✅ index.html (5KB)
  - ✅ dashboard-v18-live.html (134KB)
  - ✅ .htaccess (cache control headers)
  - ✅ version.json
  - ✅ version-test.html

### Current Status
- Files uploaded successfully to: /public_html/ascentxr-com/dev/
- Server still serving v15 due to aggressive caching
- User needs to clear Bluehost cache or access via new URL:
  - https://ascentxr.com/dev/dashboard-v18-live.html
  - https://ascentxr.com/dev/version-test.html
