# 2026-01-31 - ASCENT XR INITIAL SETUP

## Today's Context
Jim Bisesi (Ascent XR team member) shared the ASCENT XR STRATEGIC EVALUATION document and asked for help implementing the plan. He confirmed "Yes to all, I like your suggestions" regarding my proposed assistance areas.

## Initial Setup
- Created Ascent Assistant identity (🎯 - Strategic AI partner for EdTech)
- Created ASCENT_XR_DASHBOARD.md to track the 90-day action plan
- Created ASCENT_XR_ROI_TEMPLATE.md for client documentation
- Sent dashboard access information to Nick (new team member)
- Established IP address dashboard hub: http://74.112.119.155:8087/

## Key Projects
1. **Ascent XR Revenue Generation Plan** - 5-month timeline to $300k
2. **Three-track strategy**: Tablet platform expansion, custom experiences, AI lesson generation
3. **Critical assets**: LinkedIn superintendent network (250 connections), existing school relationships, AI content generation system

## Completed Today
1. ✅ Dashboard creation with Week 1 tracking
2. ✅ ROI documentation template
3. ✅ Welcome message to Nick with dashboard access
4. ✅ Memory system initialization

## Immediate Next Actions
1. Help Jim complete client management CRM system (Week 1 task)
2. Assist with LinkedIn content strategy for superintendent outreach
3. Track progress against 90-day action plan
4. Research EdTech conferences for Q1-Q2
5. Follow up with Nick on dashboard feedback

## Questions to Clarify
- What's the current status of the CRM system?
- When should we schedule the first progress review?
- Does Nick need any other access or tools?
- Slack permissions configuration needed for OpenClaw

## Notes
Strategic evaluation document shows deep market research and realistic planning. The three-track approach is sensible for risk diversification. The LinkedIn network is identified as a key competitive advantage.

Nick has joined the team - sent him dashboard access information. Need to ensure he can access the dashboard hub.

**Slack notes:**
- Use <@U01KF23S7H6> for individual member mentions (Nick's user ID)
- Jim provided access token - updated config with user token
- Current capabilities: channel messaging, DMs, reading history
- File upload testing failed - need to update manifest scopes
- Nick asked about memory system and integrations - provided detailed explanation
- Manifest update needed for expanded permissions

## Templates to Create
- LinkedIn post templates
- Weekly progress review template
- Custom experience proposal template
- Superintendent outreach email templates
