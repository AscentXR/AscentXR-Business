## 🏛️ TAX STRATEGY & OPTIMIZATION (CPA Expertise)

### 1. Business Entity Optimization

**Current Structure Analysis:**
- **Sole Proprietorship/LLC:** Pass-through taxation, self-employment tax on all profits
- **S-Corporation:** Pass-through + salary/distribution split (potential SE tax savings)
- **C-Corporation:** Double taxation but 21% flat rate, R&D credit benefits

**Recommended Analysis:**
```
Annual Review of Entity Structure:
├── Calculate tax burden under current structure
├── Model S-Corp conversion (salary vs distribution)
├── Model C-Corp (if planning significant R&D)
├── Consider QBI deduction impact (20% pass-through deduction)
└── Recommend optimal structure with breakeven analysis
```

**S-Corp Conversion Trigger:**
- Net income >$60K/year
- Minimal outside investors
- Owner active in business
- Willing to run payroll

**S-Corp Salary Guidelines:**
- Must be "reasonable" (industry standard for role)
- Typical range: 40-60% of net profit
- Remainder: Distribution (not subject to SE tax)
- **Potential Savings:** 15.3% on distribution amount

### 2. Quarterly Estimated Taxes

**2026 Estimated Tax Schedule:**
| Quarter | Period | Due Date | Safe Harbor Calculation |
|---------|--------|----------|------------------------|
| Q1 | Jan-Mar | April 15 | 25% of 2025 tax or 22.5% of 2026 |
| Q2 | Apr-May | June 15 | 50% cumulative |
| Q3 | Jun-Aug | Sept 15 | 75% cumulative |
| Q4 | Sep-Dec | Jan 15 | 100% of actual or 110% of prior year |

**Calculation Method:**
```
Projected Annual Tax Liability:
├── Projected Net Income: $XX,XXX
├── Federal Income Tax (est.): $XX,XXX
├── State Income Tax (IN 3.23%): $X,XXX
├── Self-Employment Tax: $XX,XXX
├── Less: Credits (R&D, etc.): ($X,XXX)
└── Total Estimated Tax: $XX,XXX

Quarterly Payment: Total ÷ 4
```

**Safe Harbor Rules (Avoid Penalties):**
- Pay 100% of prior year tax liability (110% if AGI >$150K)
- OR pay 90% of current year liability
- OR owe <$1,000 at year-end

**Underpayment Penalty:**
- Federal: ~6% APR on underpaid amount
- State: Varies by state

### 3. R&D Tax Credits (Critical for EdTech)

**Qualifying Activities:**
- Developing new VR/AR learning experiences
- Creating proprietary AI content generation
- Building spatial learning algorithms
- Testing educational efficacy
- Developing WebXR platform features

**Credit Calculation:**
- **Traditional Method:** 20% of qualified research expenses above base amount
- **Alternative Simplified:** 14% of QREs exceeding 50% of average QREs (3-year lookback)
- **Startup Option:** Up to $250K credit applied against payroll taxes (if <5 years old, <$5M revenue)

**Documentation Requirements:**
- Time tracking for developers/researchers
- Project descriptions and objectives
- Technical uncertainty documentation
- Process of experimentation records
- Payroll records for QREs

**2026 Estimation:**
- Developer salaries: $XX,XXX
- Percentage qualifying: ~60%
- QREs: $XX,XXX
- Estimated credit: $X,XXX-$XX,XXX

### 4. Sales Tax Compliance (SaaS)

**SaaS Taxability by State (Key Markets):**

| Illinois | Yes | 6.25% | Plus local taxes |
| Michigan | Yes | 6% | Economic nexus: $100K |

**Economic Nexus Thresholds:**
- Most states: $100K annual sales OR 200 transactions
- Must register and collect once threshold exceeded
- Track sales by state monthly

**Current Status:**
- Monitor sales by state
- Register when approaching nexus

**$10K SALT Cap Workaround (C-Corp):**
- If C-Corp: State taxes fully deductible (no cap)

## 💡 TAX OPTIMIZATION QUICK REFERENCE

### Entity Structure Decision Tree:
```
Current: LLC/Sole Prop
├── Income <$60K/year?
│   ├── YES → Stay LLC (S-Corp costs outweigh benefits)
│   └── NO → Consider S-Corp
├── Plan to take on investors?
│   ├── YES → C-Corp (QSBS benefits)
│   └── NO → S-Corp likely optimal
├── R&D-heavy business?
│   ├── YES → C-Corp (better R&D credit utilization)
│   └── NO → S-Corp likely optimal
└── Want simplicity?
    ├── YES → Stay LLC
    └── NO → S-Corp for tax savings
```

### Immediate Tax Actions (If Not Done):
1. **If LLC/Sole Prop with >$60K profit:** Analyze S-Corp election
2. **If developing software:** Start R&D documentation immediately
3. **If selling out-of-state:** Monitor nexus thresholds monthly
4. **If no retirement account:** Open Solo 401(k) before year-end
5. **If home office:** Document exclusive use space
