## 📊 R&D CREDIT CALCULATION WORKSHEET

### Method Selection:

**Method 1: Traditional (Regular Research Credit)**
```
Current Year QREs:              $___________
Base Amount (fixed % of revenue): $___________
Excess Over Base:               $___________
× 20%
= Regular Research Credit:      $___________
```

**Method 2: Alternative Simplified Credit (ASC)** ← RECOMMENDED FOR STARTUPS
```
Current Year QREs:              $___________
Less: 50% of 3-Year Avg QREs:   $___________
= Excess:                       $___________
× 14%
= Simplified Credit:            $___________
```

**Method 3: Alternative Incremental Credit** (Rarely used)
- Only if traditional method doesn't work
- Complex sliding scale based on R&D intensity

### Recommended Method by Company Stage:

| Stage | Recommended Method | Why |
|-------|-------------------|-----|
| Startup (Year 1-3) | ASC | No base amount history needed |
| Growing (Year 4-7) | Compare both | May favor traditional if R&D growing |
| Mature (Year 8+) | Traditional | Base amount established, often higher |

## 👥 QUALIFIED RESEARCH EXPENSES (QREs)

### Employee Wages (Most Common)

**Qualifying Percentages:**
| Activity Type | Qualification % | Example |
|---------------|----------------|---------|
| Direct R&D | 100% | Developer building new VR experience |
| Direct Supervision | 100% | CTO overseeing architecture design |
| Direct Support | 100% | QA testing new features |
| General Admin | 0% | HR, accounting, sales |

**Time Tracking Requirements:**
- Track by project AND by activity
- Minimum weekly documentation
- Should be contemporaneous (not reconstructed)
- Manager sign-off recommended

### Contract Research (65% Limit)

**Qualifying:**
- Third-party developers for R&D projects
- University research partnerships
- Specialized consultants (AI/ML experts)

**Calculation:**
```
Contract R&D Payments: $100,000
× 65%
= Allowable QREs: $65,000
```

**Documentation:**
- Written contract specifying R&D nature
- Invoices with project descriptions
- Payment records
- Results delivered

### Supplies (100%)

**Qualifying:**

## 📋 R&D CREDIT AUDIT DEFENSE

### Common IRS Audit Triggers:
1. Large increase in R&D credit from prior year
2. No documentation or poor documentation
3. Unusually high % of total expenses as R&D
4. Claiming 100% of wages (no allocation)
5. Retroactive time tracking (not contemporaneous)
6. Claiming routine maintenance as R&D

### Audit Defense Checklist:

**Before Filing:**
- [ ] Documentation reviewed by CPA
- [ ] Four-part test applied to all projects
- [ ] Time records contemporaneous
- [ ] Financial records reconciled
- [ ] Reasonable allocation percentages

**If Audited:**
- [ ] Engage R&D credit specialist immediately
- [ ] Gather all documentation
- [ ] Prepare project summaries
- [ ] Interview key employees
- [ ] Respond to IRS within deadlines

### Estimated Audit Costs:
- R&D credit specialist: $5,000 - $15,000
- Additional documentation: $2,000 - $5,000
- Potential adjustment/penalties: Varies

**Mitigation:** Do it right the first time with good documentation
