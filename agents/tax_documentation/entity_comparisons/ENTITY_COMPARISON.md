## 🎯 DECISION FRAMEWORK

### Step 1: Calculate Current Profit
```
Revenue: $________
Expenses: $________
Net Profit: $________

If <$60K → LLC likely optimal
If $60K-$200K → S-Corp likely optimal
If >$200K OR raising VC → C-Corp worth analyzing
```

### Step 2: Assess Future Plans
```
Taking outside investors? → C-Corp
Planning exit in 5+ years? → C-Corp (QSBS)
Want maximum simplicity? → LLC
Tax optimization priority? → S-Corp
```

### Step 3: Calculate Breakeven

**LLC to S-Corp Breakeven:**
```
Payroll Costs: ~$1,500/year
÷ 15.3% SE Tax Rate
= $9,804 profit needed to break even

RECOMMENDATION: Convert at $60K+ profit
(gives $3,000+ net savings)
```

**S-Corp to C-Corp Breakeven:**
```
More complex - depends on:
- Reinvestment vs distribution
- Investor requirements
- Exit timeline
- QSBS eligibility

Generally: C-Corp only if raising outside capital
```

## 🚨 PITFALLS TO AVOID

### S-Corp Mistakes:
- [ ] **Zero salary:** IRS reclassifies distributions as salary + penalties
- [ ] **Unreasonably low salary:** Same as zero, but harder to defend
- [ ] **No payroll:** Must run payroll at least quarterly
- [ ] **Mixing personal/corp:** Maintain separate accounts
- [ ] **Missing deadlines:** File 2553 on time, 1120-S by March 15

### C-Corp Mistakes:
- [ ] **Accumulated earnings:** >$250K retained earnings can trigger penalty tax
- [ ] **Excessive compensation:** IRS may reclassify as dividend
- [ ] **Missing corporate formalities:** Board meetings, minutes required

### All Structures:
- [ ] **Commingling funds:** Keep business/personal separate
- [ ] **Missing estimated taxes:** Penalties + interest
- [ ] **Poor documentation:** Harder to defend in audit

## 💡 OPTIMIZATION STRATEGIES

### For S-Corp Owners:
1. **Optimize salary:** Not too low (IRS risk), not too high (SE tax waste)
2. **Time distributions:** Year-end for cash flow
3. **Health insurance:** Deductible above-the-line
4. **Retirement:** Solo 401(k) contributions reduce W-2 income
5. **QBI deduction:** 20% of qualified business income

### For C-Corp Owners:
1. **QSBS planning:** Hold stock 5+ years for $10M exclusion
2. **Salary vs dividend:** Balance payroll tax vs double tax
3. **Fringe benefits:** Medical, life insurance tax-free to employee
4. **R&D credits:** Directly offset 21% corporate tax
5. **Accumulated earnings:** Plan distributions or justification
