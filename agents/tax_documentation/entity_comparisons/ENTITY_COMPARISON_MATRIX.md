## 📊 QSBS (QUALIFIED SMALL BUSINESS STOCK) ANALYSIS

### What is QSBS?
- Section 1202 of Internal Revenue Code
- Excludes up to $10M or 10x basis from capital gains
- Must be C-Corp stock held 5+ years

### Requirements:
1. **C-Corporation at issuance** (not S-Corp or LLC)
2. **Active business** (not holding company)
3. **Gross assets <$50M** at issuance
4. **Held 5+ years** by non-corporate taxpayer
5. **Qualified trade/business** (tech companies qualify)

### Benefit Example:
```
Exit Scenario:
Original Investment: $100,000
Exit Value: $5,000,000
Gain: $4,900,000

WITHOUT QSBS (LLC/S-Corp):
Capital Gains Tax (20%): $980,000
Net Proceeds: $3,920,000

WITH QSBS (C-Corp):
Excluded Gain: $4,900,000
Taxable Gain: $0
Tax Saved: $980,000
Net Proceeds: $4,900,000
```

### When QSBS Matters:
- **Planning exit in 5+ years:** Critical consideration
- **Expecting >$1M gain:** Worth C-Corp conversion
- **Raising venture capital:** Usually required by VCs
- **Current LLC/S-Corp:** Can convert to C-Corp (clock starts at conversion)

### Section 1045 Rollover:
- Sell QSBS before 5 years → reinvest in new QSBS within 60 days
- Defer gain recognition
- New 5-year clock starts

## ⚠️ COMMON MISTAKES TO AVOID

### S-Corp Mistakes:
1. **No salary:** IRS can reclassify all distributions as wages
2. **Unreasonable low salary:** Audit red flag
3. **Missing Form 2553 deadline:** Can't elect retroactively
4. **Not running payroll:** Penalties and interest
5. **Commingling funds:** Piercing corporate veil risk
6. **Missing basis tracking:** Tax reporting errors

### C-Corp Mistakes:
1. **Excessive compensation:** Reclassified as dividend
2. **Accumulated earnings tax:** >$250K retained without business purpose
3. **Personal use of corporate assets:** Taxable fringe benefit
4. **Missing corporate formalities:** Piercing veil risk
5. **Double taxation:** Withdrawing as dividend instead of salary

### LLC Mistakes:
1. **Not documenting decisions:** Piercing veil risk
2. **Ignoring operating agreement:** Disputes with partners
3. **Missing self-employment tax:** Underestimating tax burden
4. **No R&D documentation:** Missing credits
