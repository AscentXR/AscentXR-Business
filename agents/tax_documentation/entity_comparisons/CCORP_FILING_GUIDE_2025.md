## 🆕 ONE BIG BEAUTIFUL BILL ACT (OBBBA) — KEY CHANGES FOR 2025

The **One Big Beautiful Bill Act (OBBBA)**, signed July 4, 2025, includes major tax provisions affecting C-corporations:

### 100% Bonus Depreciation Restored
- **Full 100% first-year bonus depreciation** for qualified property placed in service after January 19, 2025
- Reverses the TCJA phase-down (was 60% in 2024, would have been 40% in 2025)
- Applies to new and used property with recovery period of 20 years or less

### Section 179 Increased to $2.5M
- **Deduction limit:** $2,500,000 (up from $1,250,000)
- **Phase-out threshold:** $4,120,000 (estimated, indexed)
- Effective for property acquired and placed in service after January 19, 2025
- Covers equipment, software, business vehicles, and qualified improvement property

### R&D Immediate Expensing Restored
- **Section 174 R&D expenses** can be immediately deducted again (no more 5-year amortization)
- Effective for amounts paid or incurred after January 19, 2025
- Applies to both domestic and foreign research expenditures
- Huge benefit for EdTech/software development companies like Ascent XR

### Section 199A Made Permanent at 23%
- **QBI deduction for pass-through entities** made permanent and increased to 23% (from 20%)
- **Does NOT apply to C-corporations** — this is a pass-through-only benefit
- C-corp election means forfeiting the Section 199A deduction
- Important to weigh against the 21% flat corporate rate

### QSBS (Section 1202) Enhanced

## 💼 SALARY & DISTRIBUTION REQUIREMENTS

### Reasonable Compensation

As a C-corp owner-employee, you **must** pay yourself a reasonable salary before taking distributions. The IRS applies dual scrutiny:

**The Dual Scrutiny Trap:**
- **Too low salary →** IRS reclassifies distributions as wages (payroll tax + penalties)
- **Too high salary →** IRS reclassifies portion as dividends (loses corporate deduction)

### IRS 10 Factors for Reasonable Compensation
1. Training and experience
2. Duties and responsibilities
3. Time and effort devoted to the business
4. Dividend history
5. Payments to non-shareholder employees
6. Timing and manner of paying bonuses
7. Comparable salaries in the industry
8. Compensation agreements
9. Use of a formula to determine compensation
10. Whether the corporation would have paid an independent person the same amount

### Documentation Best Practices
- Research comparable salaries annually (Glassdoor, PayScale, BLS)
- Document board resolution setting compensation
- Keep records of hours worked and duties performed
- Maintain written employment agreement

## 🔄 DOUBLE TAXATION ANALYSIS

C-corporations face double taxation: corporate-level tax on income + shareholder-level tax on dividends.

### Combined Effective Tax Rate Table

| Corporate Income | Corp Tax (21%) | After-Tax | Dividend Tax Rate | Dividend Tax | Total Tax | **Effective Rate** |
|-----------------|---------------|-----------|-------------------|-------------|-----------|-------------------|
| $50,000 | $10,500 | $39,500 | 0% (qualified) | $0 | $10,500 | **21.0%** |
| $50,000 | $10,500 | $39,500 | 15% | $5,925 | $16,425 | **32.9%** |
| $50,000 | $10,500 | $39,500 | 20% | $7,900 | $18,400 | **36.8%** |
| $100,000 | $21,000 | $79,000 | 15% | $11,850 | $32,850 | **32.9%** |
| $100,000 | $21,000 | $79,000 | 20% | $15,800 | $36,800 | **36.8%** |
| $200,000 | $42,000 | $158,000 | 20% + 3.8% NIIT | $37,564 | $79,564 | **39.8%** |

> **Range: 21.0% (no distributions) to 39.8% (full distribution at top bracket + NIIT)**

### Net Investment Income Tax (NIIT)
- Additional **3.8%** on investment income (including dividends) for AGI >$200K (single) / >$250K (MFJ)
- Makes the worst-case combined rate: 21% + (1 - 0.21) × 23.8% = **39.8%**

## 🛡️ STRATEGIES TO MITIGATE DOUBLE TAXATION

### 1. Maximize Deductible Salary
- Salary is a deductible corporate expense → reduces corporate taxable income
- Subject to payroll taxes but avoids dividend double taxation
- Must be "reasonable" — balance is key

### 2. Maximize Fringe Benefits
- Health insurance, group life, dependent care, education assistance — all deductible to corp, tax-free to owner
- See fringe benefits section below

### 3. Retain Earnings for Business Growth
- Retained earnings taxed at 21% only (no dividend tax until distributed)
- Watch the $250K accumulated earnings threshold (see below)
- Document business purpose for retaining earnings

### 4. Employer Retirement Contributions
- Corp contributes to 401(k) → deductible to corp, tax-deferred to owner
- Up to $69,000 total (employee + employer) for 2025
- Catch-up contribution: additional $7,500 if age 50+

### 5. QSBS Planning (Section 1202)
- Hold qualifying stock for 5+ years
- Exclude up to $10M or 10× basis from capital gains
- See QSBS section below

### 6. Charitable Contributions
- C-corps can deduct up to 10% of taxable income for charitable contributions
- Excess carries forward 5 years

## 🏥 FRINGE BENEFIT ADVANTAGES (C-Corp vs S-Corp)

C-corporations offer significant fringe benefit advantages for owner-employees that S-corps cannot match:

| Fringe Benefit | C-Corp Owner | S-Corp Owner (>2%) |
|---------------|-------------|-------------------|
| **Health Insurance Premiums** | Deductible to corp, **tax-free** to owner | Included in W-2, deductible above-the-line only |
| **Group Term Life (up to $50K)** | Deductible to corp, **tax-free** to owner | Included in W-2 as income |
| **Dependent Care Assistance ($5K)** | Deductible to corp, **tax-free** to owner | Included in W-2 as income |
| **Education Assistance ($5,250)** | Deductible to corp, **tax-free** to owner | Included in W-2 as income |
| **Health Reimbursement Arrangement** | Deductible to corp, **tax-free** to owner | Not available to >2% shareholders |
| **Disability Insurance** | Deductible to corp | Deductible to corp |
| **Meals (on-premises)** | 50% deductible | 50% deductible |

> 💡 **Key Advantage:** C-corp owner health insurance is fully deductible by the corporation AND tax-free to the owner — a significant tax benefit not available to S-corp >2% shareholders.

## ⚠️ ACCUMULATED EARNINGS TAX

### Overview
The IRS imposes a **20% penalty tax** on C-corporations that accumulate earnings beyond reasonable business needs, to prevent using the corporation as a tax shelter.

### Key Thresholds
| Item | Amount |
|------|--------|
| **Accumulated Earnings Credit** | $250,000 (most corporations) |
| **Penalty Tax Rate** | 20% on excess accumulated taxable income |
| **Personal Service Corp Credit** | $150,000 |

### How It Works
```
Accumulated Taxable Income:
  Taxable Income
  + Dividends-Received Deduction
  - Federal Income Tax
  - Charitable Contributions (excess)
  - Accumulated Earnings Credit ($250K)
  = Accumulated Taxable Income
  × 20% = Accumulated Earnings Tax
```

### Documentation Requirements
To justify retaining earnings above $250K, document:
- Specific, definite, and feasible business expansion plans
- Equipment purchase plans with quotes/proposals
- Working capital needs (operating cycle analysis)
- Debt repayment schedules
- Product development roadmap (R&D plans)
- Potential acquisitions under consideration
- Self-insurance reserves (if applicable)

### Best Practices
- Maintain board resolutions documenting reasons for retained earnings
- Create written business plans justifying accumulation
- Review annually and distribute excess if no business purpose
- Consider timing of large purchases to manage accumulation levels

## 🎯 QSBS — QUALIFIED SMALL BUSINESS STOCK (SECTION 1202)

### Eligibility Requirements
| Requirement | Detail |
|-------------|--------|
| **Entity Type** | Must be a C-corporation |
| **Gross Assets** | ≤ $50M at time of stock issuance (and immediately after) |
| **Active Business** | ≥ 80% of assets used in active qualified trade or business |
| **Holding Period** | Stock held for 5+ years |
| **Original Issuance** | Stock acquired at original issuance (not secondary market) |

### Exclusion Benefits
| Acquisition Date | Exclusion Percentage | Max Exclusion |
|-----------------|---------------------|---------------|
| After Sept 27, 2010 | **100%** | Greater of $10M or 10× adjusted basis |
| Feb 18, 2009 – Sept 27, 2010 | 75% | Same formula |
| Before Feb 18, 2009 | 50% | Same formula |

### OBBBA Enhancements
- The OBBBA confirmed and strengthened QSBS provisions
- 100% exclusion remains for qualifying stock

### Qualifying Trades or Businesses
✅ Technology/software development (EdTech qualifies)
✅ Manufacturing
✅ Wholesale/retail trade
❌ Professional services (law, accounting, consulting)
❌ Banking, insurance, financing
❌ Farming
❌ Hotels, restaurants, similar businesses

### Ascent XR QSBS Considerations
- EdTech/software development is a qualifying business
- Ensure gross assets remain under $50M at issuance
- Document original issuance of stock
- Track 5-year holding period from issuance date
- Maintain records proving >80% active business test

---

## 📊 SECTION 199A — DOES NOT APPLY

> ⚠️ **Important:** The Section 199A Qualified Business Income (QBI) deduction does **NOT** apply to C-corporations.

- OBBBA made Section 199A **permanent** and increased it to **23%** (from 20%)
- This deduction is exclusively for **pass-through entities** (sole proprietorships, partnerships, S-corps)
- By electing C-corp treatment, Ascent XR forfeits the Section 199A deduction
- Trade-off: 21% flat corporate rate vs. pass-through rates with 23% QBI deduction
- The increased 23% QBI deduction under OBBBA makes this comparison more significant — model both scenarios when reviewing entity structure
