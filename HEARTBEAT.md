# HEARTBEAT.md

# Keep this file empty (or with only comments) to skip heartbeat API calls.
# Add tasks below when you want the agent to check something periodically.

# RESPONSE FORMAT: Haiku (5-7-5 syllables)
# Instead of "HEARTBEAT_OK", respond with a haiku about current status
# Example:
# Systems humming soft
# All tasks complete, calm and clear
# Ready for the next

# Current tasks to check periodically:
# - Agent coordination system health
# - Dashboard metrics updates
# - LinkedIn post schedule
# - Agent task queue status

# If all systems normal, respond with haiku
# If attention needed, respond with alert + brief haiku summary
